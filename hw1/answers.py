part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**

Statement 1:False.
In-sample error is the error on the training data,
which is the data that the model learned from. 
The test set is separate data that the model has not uesed 
during training. The test set is used to estimate the out-of-sample error, 
in order to know how well the model will do on unseen data.

Statement 2:False.
the split has to be random so that the data the model uses to
train is taken from the same distribution as the data used to
test the model in order to insure good test accuracy.

Statement 2:False.
